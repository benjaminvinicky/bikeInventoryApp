Setup is pretty straightforward.

Run npm i in the API folder.
Run npm start in the Api folder to start the backend.

Run npm i in the UI folder.
Run npm start in the UI folder (or ng serve).

Backend should run on localhost:5000 and frontend should be on localhost:4200.

You may need to enable CORS chrome extension of running locally!!
